# Battle Royale Game

## About This Project

This game was created by myself and two other students for CpS 209 Application Development.

It was built using Xamarin and UrhoSharp libraries.

During this project, we learned how to do Object-Oriented Programming, Test-Driven Development, and use Xamarin to build a complete GUI application.

Watch the below video demo or build it yourself using Visual Studio and Xamarin.
